# odious

### This project has been archived.
This repo was originally supposed to hold a ChilloutVR client, but ChilloutVR is a mostly dead game as most of the people that complained about EAC and "boycotted" it just went back to VRChat over time.

You are free to look at the VRChat client that was here in the previous commits, but in all honesty it was mostly pasted garbage I used to teach myself basic C# as I had never done anything with it before.

All in all, I thank everyone that supported me or even used Odious when it was an actual VRChat client (even if it was really bad and pasted)

Hope you all the best futures,\
Unixian.
